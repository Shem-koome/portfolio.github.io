            <h3>Web Developer/Graphics Designer!</h3>
            <p>
                I'm <b>Shem Koome Mbae</b> the <b>C.E.O</b> of a non registered company <b>Millionaire Entreprise</b> 
                <br> <br>A <b>Web Developer and Graphics Designer</b>, Pursuing <b>Bsc.Computer Science</b> at karatina University. <br><br>
                           My work philosophy is to be creative in everything I do for a company <br> <br>
                           challenging myself continously, even in aspects of my job which I'm already familiar.
                           <br><br>
                           I try to provide unique solutions to complex workplace problems even if my work isn't particularly creative. <br><br>
                           I like helping lead teams towards various solutions instead of relying on repeated tactics when completing a project. <br><br>
                           I also work well in teams because brainstorming ideas and solutions with others allows me to approach my work with a creative mindset. <br> <br>
                           Though I can work indepedently, working as a team helps me discover new ideas and develop unique answers to various challenges. <br> <br>
                           Have received a <b>HTML course completion certificate</b> from <b>Programming hub </b> and 
                           <b>Introduction into Cyber Security certificate</b> from <b>CISCO.</b> <br><br>
                           Am inspired daily by big Cyber Security and Programming gurus the likes of Bright Gameli e.t.c <br><br>
                           My hobbies are Problem solving, Programming, Photography, Designing, Hiking, Socializing, e.t.c   <br> <br>
                           I currently live in karatina and am available for freelance jobs. <br> <br>
                           <b>THANK YOU.</b>
